# MSC1929 - Homeserver Admin Contact and Support Page

MRS has builtin support of [`/.well-known/matrix/support`](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#getwell-knownmatrixsupport) endpoint, using the [github.com/etkecc/go-msc1929](https://github.com/etkecc/go-msc1929) library.

Additionally, MRS supports providing **room** admin contacts via room description (see below).

## Why?

The main purpose of Matrix Rooms Search is index and provide a human-friendly interface for vast Matrix Federation.
Unfortunately, some people are doing illegal things and sharing illegal content using internet, including Matrix protocol.

To help fighting with illegal content, we at [etke.cc](https://etke.cc) developed the native MSC1929 integration.

## How it works?

MRS will parse MSC1929 contacts automatically during the discovery phase and store them into db.
When a room is reported using the `/mod/report/{room_id}` endpoint, MRS will check if the room's server
has MSC1929 contacts. If email address(-es) are listed within the contacts, report details will be sent
to the administrators of the Matrix server to which the room belongs.

Apart from that, MRS serves the MSC1929 contacts endpoint to provide a human-friendly interface for the contacts,
the same way as it expects from other servers.

### How it works with room description?

As a room administrator/moderator, you could add special string to the room description to indicate that you want to be contacted
in case of the room is reported. This contact will be used alongside the MSC1929 contacts (if any), and it could be used as ownership proof (that's up to specific MRS instance).


### Emails priority order

MRS will try to find any moderator emails, then (if none found), admin emails from the MSC1929 file (where `role` is `m.role.admin`),
but if there is no moderator and/or admin emails, MRS will try to find any emails in the file.

## How to opt-in?

Add `/.well-known/matrix/support` file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "contacts": [
    {
      "email_address": "your@email.here",
      "matrix_id": "@your:mxid.here",
      "role": "m.role.admin"
    }
  ]
}
```
File must be served on the homeserver name domain (`@you:example.com` -> `https://example.com/.well-known/matrix/support`)

At this moment, **MRS works with emails only**

### How to opt-in as a room admin/moderator?

Add the following to the room description:

```
<matrix.server_name from MRS config.yml>:email:<your@email.address>
```

Example:

```
example.com:email:admin@example.com
```

The best place to add that string is the end of the room topic, because it will be removed from the topic when MRS will process it
(that is purely technical information and workaround, so it should not be indexed and it not meant to be searchable via MRS).


## How to opt-out?

Just unlist your email from the MSC1929 file and/or from the room description.

## Why MRS doesn't contact me when a room from my server is reported?

You have to serve the `/.well-known/matrix/support` file with at least 1 email in it,
or add the room description with your email address (see above).

in case of [etke.cc/ansible](https://github.com/etkecc/ansible) and [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy), add the following to your `vars.yml` configuration file:

```yaml
matrix_static_files_file_matrix_support_enabled: true
matrix_static_files_file_matrix_support_property_m_contacts:
  - matrix_id: "@you:example.com" # optional, remove if not needed
    email_address: "you@example.com" # required for MRS MSC1929 integration
    role: "m.role.admin"
matrix_homeserver_support_url: "https://example.com/help" # optional, remove if not needed
```
